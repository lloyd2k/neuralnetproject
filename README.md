Simple Neural Network project from scratch
(Hand written digit recognition)

- Inspired by 3Blue1Brown Deep Learning series
- Sample data used from MNIST database
- Currently only uses Sigmoid activation function, other activation functions will be updated soon
- Will add a graph of cost function vs iteration using matplotlib to compare differences between different activation functions (e.g. Sigmoid, ReLU, Leaky ReLU, ELU, tanh)
- Will implement cross-entropy and Softmax function for output layer
- Will try different weight initialisation techniques
